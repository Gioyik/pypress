# Pypress
Just a python script that takes obfuscation in javascript files to the next level.

## Is this necessary?
In some cases you want publish unreadable and extraordinarily difficult code to debug. There are other tools that do this, but is good as educational example. Not recomended for production but with a few eceptions.

## Use
Be sure you have installed `python 2.7`, `slimit` and `unidecode`.

Now just run it with the input file and the output path.
 
```
./pypress.py "input.js" "out.js"
```
